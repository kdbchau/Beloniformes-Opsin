# Opsin Evolution in Beloniformes Fishes

This project looks at extracting cone opsin sequences from fishes belonging to the order Beloniformes, and testing for changes in selection patterns within the cone opsins. This project uses bioinformatics and PAML to analyze selection patterns and the evolution of vision in fishes that transitioned from marine to freshwater habitats, as well as transitioned from a generalized diet to more specialized diets.

## 1.1. Additional Software
This includes software that was used but not installed onto a cluster, rather, they are available online.


A fast, unconstrained Bayesian approximation for inferring selection ([FUBAR](http://www.datamonkey.org/fubar)) was conducted using the [Datamonkey Server](http://www.datamonkey.org/).
